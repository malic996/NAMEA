[AAAI 2026] A PyTorch official implementation for [Boosting Adversarial Transferability via Ensemble Non-Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.08937)

This work is the first to explore the power of ensemble non-attention in improving cross-architecture transferability. We propose a novel ensemble attack, NAMEA, which integrates ensemble non-attention and meta learning to ensure stable update direction and model diversity at once.
